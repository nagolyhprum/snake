Snake game for demo

Start the game
==============

```bash
npm i
npm run dev
```

This should automatically open it in a browser

Other commands
==============

 * `npm run lint` - lints (fixes what it can) and formats your code using standard js
 * `npm run test` - runs all tests using jest and generates coverage
 * `npm run ci` - lints and tests your code with coverage

Future of Snake
===============

 * Improve graphics - make the snake thinner so it is easier to know where it is going and where it is coming from
 * Improve the controls - also I made it harder to go back on yourself it is still possible
 * Change speed over time - maybe get faster/slower as time passes
 * Add a scoreboard and show highscores managed by some backend
 * Allow key customization
 * Add a pause, start, and controls screens
 * Embed the game in a website
 * Make it so that you can move fast or generally control the speed
 * Add an end sequence
 * Minify for production
 * Use Typescript
